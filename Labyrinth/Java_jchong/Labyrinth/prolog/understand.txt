Data structures:

1. Player
player(name, heuristic, row/column)
Represents the player name, heuristic used and the row and column of its current position

2. Game State
game_state(name, 1)
game_state(a,1) player a´ move to shift a row/column
game_state(a,2) player a move to move

game_state(b,1) player b´ move to shift a row/column
game_state(b,2) player b move to move


3. Treasures
treasures([	sword/1/3, ring/1/5, map/3/1, 
			keys/3/3, helmet/3/5, gold/3/7, 
			fairy/5/1, gem/5/3, chest/5/5, 
			candle/5/7, book/7/3, crown/7/5]).
List of treasures, every element represents a treasure in a position, treasure/row/column

4. Board
The board is represented as a 7x7 Matrix (List of row Lists), setup with create_board

The main loop of the AI:

 A commented source code;
2. A report (max 4 pages) which describes the programmed game, its rules, the description of the
different heuristics, the sources (links) of all the non original material, a report on the efficiency
of the algorithms and a set of tests for each heuristic implemented.
Here are the points that will decrease your grade (not uniformly):
1. We have not heard about you or your team before the project defense;
2. The project has not been sent before the defense;
3. The code is of poor Prolog quality (you programmed in an “imperative” way);  ?
4. The code is not commented (even it is not your own code);  OK
5. The project has not been tested or the tests are not available in the report; OK
6. The project does not work (it is impossible to play); OK
7. The project use some code from the Internet (and worse, more than 60% or even worse, the
sources are not cited);  No code from internet, but transpose_matrix and split_matrix are from Elisa's solution
8. There is less heuristics implemented than the number of members in the team; 4 heuristics
9. Some students in the team have not done anything; Revise
10. The computer takes more than X seconds to play a move (the higher the X, the worse the
penalty); What is the min X
11. The team has invented a trivial game; OK
12. The computer plays stupidly; OK
13. The demo was not convincing (e.g. not prepared). OK
