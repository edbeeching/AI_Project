- Fixed tiles are stable during the whole game, so staying on a fixed tile at the end of your turn, assures that you will be at the same place 
at your next turn.

-Manhattan Distance: The Manhattan distance function computes the distance that would be traveled to get from one data point to the other if a grid-like path is followed. 
The Manhattan distance between two items is the sum of the differences of their corresponding components. 
The formula for this distance between a point X=(X1, X2, etc.) and a point Y=(Y1, Y2, etc.) is:[ Î£(i=1 to n) of |X(i) - Y(i)| ]

-Use "shortcuts" : When you are at the 'end' of a row or column and pushed out, you go to the other side.

-Anti-Game(?) : Instead of looking the best way to win, try to put your opponent in a difficult situation.
