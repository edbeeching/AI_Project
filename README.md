# Brief introduction
5 Heuristics were implemented in the Prolog language, a User interface has been implemented in Java, using the Swing UI toolkit.
Java-Prolog communication was achieved with the JPL library.
For more details of the project, including a UML diagram, look at the [Project Report](Intro_to_AI_Prolog_Game_Project_Report_EB_JC_SJ_DT_.pdf).

For Prolog code, look in directory [here](Labyrinth/Java/Labyrinth/prolog)

Here's what the finall UI looked like, note the main focus of the course was the AI code.
