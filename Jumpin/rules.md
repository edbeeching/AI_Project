Each player, in turn, tries to move one of his pawns as far as possible by **"leap frogging"** rank(accross)
and file (down), either back and forth over single pawns and solid rows of pawns - all in one move (as long
as there is an empty hole to receive his pawn). He cannot move merely to the next hole, he cannot jump over a hole,
nor can he move diagonally. Winner is first player to get all of his pawns to the opposite side.
